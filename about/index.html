                    <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;hello my name is Norman Andrianyah. usually called Norman. is creating and program HTML, CSS, javascript, C, C++, java, GLSL, PBR and POM. welcome to my first blog.I live in the country of born in Cilacap and live in Cimahi, i am 13 years old. my expertise is playing video games and coding html, css, glsl. I also own a small company called Arthenal Graphics ;P</p>
                    <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; i make Normal map and Specular map for Minecraft. i learn resourcepack for Minecraft since 2018. at first i studied for pocket edition, Since i saw Youtube, i want to make a realistic texture pack. but i don't think that's possible. after that i saw on youtube, and i learn from <a href="https://continuum.graphics">Continuum Graphics</a></p>
                    <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;first after I got to know the Minecraft game, I was curious and wanted to play it, but unfortunately the game was paid for. so I decided to look for a game that looks like Minecraft, then I found it. apparently what I got was an old version of Minecraft. it turns out it's also worse than I imagined, I only have a few blocks and fewer items. even during adventure there are only a few areas of the world. and after that I decided to delete it. by the way, that was my story when I was 10 years old and it was also searching on Google</p>
                    <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;I look for a game that I think fills the saturation, I see an ad on YouTube where the game is similar to Minecraft. the game is called MWBA (Mini World: Block Art). there are games like PvP, rather than my guess that Minecraft can't do Multiplayer. I used to be a kid, so I don't know anything about Minecraft. a year later I downloaded Minecraft beta on 5play.ru version 1.9, that's where I got to know Minecraft. I'm free to do anything with the command. I never thought it was better than MWBA</p>

                    <h3>my story before getting to know Minecraft and making texture</h3>
                </div>
                <div class="paragraph">
                    <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;a few weeks I saw a shader that made Minecraft Realistic, but after it was installed the source package didn't work, because the versions of gl and variables were different. look how stupid I am that there is a special video for Minecraft PE, but that is just a thumbnail of someone else's picture using the java edition. and not suitable to draw or you could say that the video is just clickbait, so it was just a trick, I was looking for MCPE, but that's also the same, only thumbnails and clickbait.</p>
                    <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;a few months later, I started trying to make my own Resourcepack without seeing a tutorial on YouTube, which is pretty cool? I made a resourcepack that was originally a pirated texture, moreover I edited it a little and also the worst was uploaded to MCPE Master. illegal right? I decided to delete it and try not to create the resourcepack again. Moreover, the shader is also pirated.</p>
                    <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; a few years later I have a PC (Personal Computer), I use it as coding, playing games, etc. a few months later I searched for free minecraft java edition. the name is TLauncher, I used to think TLauncher was very similar to Minecraft Launcher in general. but I realized after I tried to make Realm and also played premium servers like Hypixel. but I can be thankful for that because I can install shaders, so are the Normal map and Specular map features. so I can enjoy it</p>
                    <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; that's when I started trying to make a resourcepack for Minecraft Java edition, in the resourcepack there are features like Normal, and also a specular map. it makes my Minecraft easier to play. a few weeks later I tried to create a resource pack similar to Ray Tracing called Arthenal. I tried to make the texture because I wanted to continue the generation of Ray Tracing Resourcepack by Indonesian children. so that's where Arthenal was born to make Minecraft more realistic with PBR and POM / Normals and Speculars.</p>
