                    <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;hello my name is Norman Andrianyah. usually called Norman. is creating and program HTML, CSS, javascript, C, C++, java, GLSL, PBR and POM. welcome to my first blog.I live in the country of born in Cilacap and live in Cimahi, i am 13 years old. my expertise is playing video games and coding html, css, glsl. I also own a small company called Arthenal Graphics ;P</p>
                    <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; i make Normal map and Specular map for Minecraft. i learn resourcepack for Minecraft since 2018. at first i studied for pocket edition, Since i saw Youtube, i want to make a realistic texture pack. but i don't think that's possible. after that i saw on youtube, and i learn from <a href="https://continuum.graphics">Continuum Graphics</a></p>
                    <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;first after I got to know the Minecraft game, I was curious and wanted to play it, but unfortunately the game was paid for. so I decided to look for a game that looks like Minecraft, then I found it. apparently what I got was an old version of Minecraft. it turns out it's also worse than I imagined, I only have a few blocks and fewer items. even during adventure there are only a few areas of the world. and after that I decided to delete it. by the way, that was my story when I was 10 years old and it was also searching on Google</p>
                    <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;I look for a game that I think fills the saturation, I see an ad on YouTube where the game is similar to Minecraft. the game is called MWBA (Mini World: Block Art). there are games like PvP, rather than my guess that Minecraft can't do Multiplayer. I used to be a kid, so I don't know anything about Minecraft. a year later I downloaded Minecraft beta on 5play.ru version 1.9, that's where I got to know Minecraft. I'm free to do anything with the command. I never thought it was better than MWBA</p>

                    <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; Texture pack or also called resourcepack for Minecraft, is our project. we made a texturepack / resourcepack for Minecraft to change the texture of blocks, items, etc. and why did I make it? many Minecraft players are texture developers, because to replace them is very easy. Moreover, there is also a Shader developer for Minecraft. We make a variety of textures, but with a normal map and specular, so that the texture is more realistic than usual. My texture is also made by yourself, if you want to participate in making textures, connect our GitHub. POM and PBR textures are not ordinary textures, normal maps and specular maps, can only be made in certain software</p>
